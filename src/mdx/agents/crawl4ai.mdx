# Crawl4AI

Crawl4AI is a specialized web crawling tool designed specifically for AI applications. It helps in gathering and processing web data that can be used to train AI models or feed into AI-powered applications.

## Overview

Crawl4AI simplifies the process of collecting structured data from websites while maintaining compliance with robots.txt and other web crawling best practices.

## Key Features

- Intelligent crawling patterns
- Built-in data preprocessing
- AI-friendly data output formats
- Rate limiting and politeness controls
- Automatic handling of JavaScript-rendered content

## Installation

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from crawl4ai import Crawler

# Initialize the crawler
crawler = Crawler()

# Set up crawling configuration
crawler.configure({
    'start_urls': ['https://example.com'],
    'allowed_domains': ['example.com'],
    'max_depth': 3
})

# Start crawling
data = crawler.run()
```

## Best Practices

1. Always respect robots.txt
2. Implement appropriate delays between requests
3. Use selective crawling to gather relevant data only
4. Handle errors and retries gracefully
5. Store crawled data in structured formats

## Integration with AI Workflows

Crawl4AI can be easily integrated with various AI frameworks and tools:

```python
# Example integration with a language model
from crawl4ai import Crawler
from langchain import LLMChain

# Crawl data
crawler = Crawler()
data = crawler.run()

# Process with LLM
llm_chain = LLMChain(...)
processed_data = llm_chain.run(data)
```
