# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.

## Installation

1. Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your platform
3. Verify installation: `rustc --version`

## Basic Syntax

```rust
// Variables and data types
let name = "Rust";
let mut count = 0; // Mutable variable
let is_awesome: bool = true;

// Structs
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

// Implementation blocks
impl Person {
    fn new(name: String, age: u32) -> Person {
        Person { name, age }
    }
    
    fn greet(&self) -> String {
        format!("Hello, I'm {}!", self.name)
    }
}

// Error handling with Result
fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        Err(String::from("Division by zero"))
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}
```

## Package Management

```bash
# Create a new project
cargo new my_project

# Build project
cargo build

# Run project
cargo run

# Add dependency
cargo add package_name

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Best Practices

1. Use the type system to prevent bugs
2. Handle errors explicitly
3. Follow ownership and borrowing rules
4. Use cargo for dependency management
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Use meaningful variable names
7. Document your code with rustdoc
8. Use modules to organize code
