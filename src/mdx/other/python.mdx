pip install package-name

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# Unix/MacOS
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. Use virtual environments
2. Follow PEP 8 style guide
3. Write docstrings for documentation
