# Docker

Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.

## Installation

1. Download Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Start Docker Desktop

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull image-name

# List running containers
docker ps

# Build an image
docker build -t image-name .

# Run a container
docker run image-name
```

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

## Best Practices

1. Use official base images
2. Minimize layers
3. Don't install unnecessary packages
4. Use .dockerignore
5. Use multi-stage builds
6. Keep images small and focused
